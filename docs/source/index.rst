**text2story** is Python library that intends to extract narrative components
(events, participants, time expressions and their relations) in a easy and flexible way. In addition to
that, it allows to visualize annotations of narratives (manual or automatic). Finally, a benchmark module
is available for experiments.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
